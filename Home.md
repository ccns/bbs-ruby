## About BBS-Ruby

BBS-Ruby is a binding that provides a Ruby scripting environment for BBS. It allows users to write custom programs that run on the BBS. Security is also concerned and is guarded by Ruby's security mechanisms (library whitelist on mruby or `$SAFE` level on CRuby). The users have no access to any object you don't expose to them.
