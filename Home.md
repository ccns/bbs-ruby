## About BBS-Ruby

BBS-Ruby is a binding that provides a Ruby scripting environment for BBS. It allows users to write custom programs that run on the BBS. Security is also concerned and is guarded by Ruby's security level mechanism (`$SAFE` level). The users have no access to any object you don't expose to them.
